Tracking other projects
======================================================================

This is working note for tracking activities other projects,
especially activity at exuberant-ctags.

I put this as the top of this hacking guide because
I consider tracking activities as the first class fruits
of this project.


exuberant-ctags
----------------------------------------------------------------------

subversion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* status

  Revisions up to <r815> are merged except:

	NOTHING HERE NOW

  (Mon Sep 22 12:41:32 2014 by yamato)

* howto

  ::

      <svn>
      => <git: local exuberant repo>
	 => <git: local fishman repo>


  1. prepare your own fishman repo: a local git repo cloned from github.
     You may know how to do it :)

     ::
    
	$ git clone https://github.com/fishman/ctags.git

  2. prepare exuberant SVN repo: a local git repo clone from exuberant svn tree.

    The original clone is already part of fishman tree.

    To initialize your git repository with the required subversion information do ::

	$ git svn init https://svn.code.sf.net/p/ctags/code/trunk
	$ git update-ref refs/remotes/git-svn refs/remotes/origin/sourceforge

    and then ::

	$ git svn fetch
	$ git svn rebase

    to get the latest changes and reflect it to the local copy.

  3. merge

    TODO

  4. cherry-pick

     4.1. Make a branch at local fishman repo and switch to it.

     4.2. Do cherry-pick like::

	 	$ git cherry-pick -s -x c81a8ce

     You can find commit id on the another terminal
     <git: local exuberant repo>::

	 	$ git log
	 
     or ::
	 
	 	$ git log --oneline

     If conflicts are occurred in cherry-picking, you can
     abort/reset cherry-picking with::

	 $ git reset --hard

     <git: local fishman repo>
      at the branch for picking.

`patches <https://sourceforge.net/p/ctags/patches/%d>`_
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Tracking the tickets in patch tracker is quite fruitful.
Patches are always there. So it is easy to evaluate the value:)

   [(<]TICKET#[>)] TITLE

	* STATUS

	  + MORE STATUS

   <TICKET#> 

   	means the ticket is closed from the view of fishman tree
   	developers.  We don't have to take time for this ticket.

   (TICKET#) 

   	means the ticket is still opened from the view of fishman
	tree developers.  We don't have to take time for this ticket.

    <[Ctags-devel] Lack of fnmatch(3) in Windows>
    From: Frank Fesevur <ffes@us...> - 2013-08-24 20:25:47

	There is no fnmatch() in the Windows C library. Therefore
	a string comparison is done in fileNameMatched() in
	strlist.c and patterns are not recognized::

Debian
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Some patches are maintained in ctags package of Debian.
Inventory of patches are
http://anonscm.debian.org/cgit/users/cjwatson/exuberant-ctags.git/tree/debian/patches/series

(python-disable-imports.patch)

	Not in fishman tree.
	
	I don't want to merge this patch. I think ctags should extract
	as much as possible information from input source code.
	The user has responsibility to filter out the noise.
	The definition of noise is up to the user.

Other interesting ctags repositories
----------------------------------------------------------------------
There are several interesting repo's with ctags around. These are
interesting to integrate in the future.


Geany
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Repo

	https://github.com/geany/geany/tree/master/tagmanager/ctags

Geany has created a library out of ctags

  	https://github.com/fishman/ctags/issues/63

Their language parsers have many improvements to various parsers.
Changes known by fishman devs worth backporting:

* HTML reads <h1><h2><h3> tags
* Make has support for targets
* Various fixes for D parser (c.c), but currently the code diverges
  from ours to some extent.


They have these additional language parsers:

* `Abaqus <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abaqus>`_
* `ActionScript <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActionScript>`_
* `AsciiDoc <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AsciiDoc>`_
* `DocBook <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DocBook>`_
* `Ferite (c.c) <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferite>`_
* `GLSL (c.c) <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL_Shading_Language>`_
* `Haskell <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell_%28programming_language%29>`_
* `Haxe <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haxe>`_
* `NSIS <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nullsoft_Scriptable_Install_System>`_
* `R <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_%28programming_language%29>`_
* `Rust <http://rust-lang.org>`_
* `reStructuredText (reST) <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReStructuredText>`_
* `txt2tags <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Txt2tags>`_ 
* `Vala (c.c) <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vala_%28programming_language%29>`_


These changes have been merged:

* Fix regex callback match count - https://github.com/fishman/ctags/pull/104 
* SQL tags are stored with scopes instead of "tablename.field" - https://github.com/fishman/ctags/pull/100
* Some fixes for D parser


`VIM-Japan <https://github.com/vim-jp/ctags/>`_
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

VIM-Japan have some interesting things, especially regarding encoding

`Anjuta <https://git.gnome.org/browse/anjuta/tree/plugins/symbol-db/anjuta-tags>`_
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Anjuta is a Gnome IDE. They did not fork Exuberant ctags, but they did
natively include it in Anjuta. They have made several additions to
their version of it including fairly extensive Vala language support.

tagbar

Wiki

	https://github.com/majutsushi/tagbar/wiki

This is a gold mine of xcmd and optlib.

	
External command(xcmd)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Near feature fishman-ctags can invoke external command as a
specialized parser though some glue code or script may be
needed. Sometimes we may have to hack the external command to adjust
the interface between the command and fishman-ctags.

So let's track external commands maintained out fishman-ctags. If we
prepare glue code or script, mark it with <>, and if not, mark it with
().

<`CoffeeTags <https://github.com/lukaszkorecki/CoffeeTags>`_>
	
	This is the primary target during developing xcmd
	feature. CoffeeTags side hacking is done.
