======================================================================

:Maintainer: Masatake YAMATO <yamato@redhat.com>

----

Many changes have been introduced in fishman-ctags. Here I (Masatake
YAMATO) enumerate the changes mainly in common part. About changes
not enumerated here especially in language parsers, inquire git-log.

Importing the most of all changes from exuberant-ctags
---------------------------------------------------------------------
See "exuberant-ctags" in "Tracking other projects" about the status of
importing. Some changes in Fedora and Debian are also imported.

New parsers
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Following parsers are added.

* ada
* coffee *xcmd*
* css
* d
* ctags option library *optlib*
* falcon
* go
* json
* mib *optlib*
* rust *optlib*
* windres
* SystemVerilog

See "Option library" about  *optlib*.
See "External parser command" about *xcmd*.


Heavily improved language parsers
---------------------------------------------------------------------
* php
* verilog


New test facility named *Units*
---------------------------------------------------------------------
The existing test facility *Test* checks differences between the
output of older ctags and newer ctags. If a difference is found, it is
recognized as failed. *Test* expects older ctags works fine.

This expectation is not always met. Consider you add a new parser for
a language. You may want to add a sample source code for the language
to *Test*. Older ctags cannot make good tags file for the sample
code. Newer ctags can make it. In this point a difference is found;
and *Test* reports failure.

In other hand *Units* compares the expected output which a test
developer prepares and the output of ./ctags just built.  The expected
output doesn't depend on ctags. Many part of changes I made
is covered by *Units*. Fore more detail see "Using *Units*".

Running tests under valgrind
---------------------------------------------------------------------
With the following command line tests can be run under valgrind memory
checker.

::

	$ make -f testing.mak VG=1 SHELL=/bin/bash

NOTE: ``/bin/bash`` is needed to report the result.


Semi-fuzz testing
---------------------------------------------------------------------
One of the frustrating thing is that ctags enters infinite loop
against unexpected input. I wanted to decrease this kind of bugs.
In fuzz target of testing.mak I tried to spot them by giving
semi-random(semi-broken) input to parses.

::

	$ make -f testing.mak fuzz LANGUAGES=LANG1[,LANG2,...]

With this command line, you can given all test inputs under
*Units/\*/input.\** to parsers specified with ``LANGUAGES`` macro
variable. The output of ctags is just ignored. This target just
checks the exit status. Ctags is run under timeout command
in fuzz target, therefore if ctags enters an infinite loop,
ctags will exits with non-zero status because timeout command
may terminate the ctags process. The timeout will be reported
like this::

	[timeout C]                Units/test.vhd.t/input.vhd

This means C parser doesn't stop in 1 second when
*Units/test.vhd.t/input.vhd* is given as an input. The default
duration 1 second can be changed with ``TIMEOUT=N`` argument for
*make* command. If no timeout but the exit status is non-zero,
the target reports it as following::

	[unexpected-status(N) C]                Units/test.vhd.t/input.vhd

You can get the list of parsers which can be used as a value
for ``LANGUAGES`` with following command line

::

	$ ./ctags --list-languages

Other than ``LANGUAGES`` and ``TIMEOUT`` fuzz target take following parameters:

	``VG=1``

		Run ctags under valgrind. If valgrind finds memory
		error it is reported like::

			[valgrind-error Verilog]                Units/array_spec.f90.t/input.f90

		The report of valgrind is recorded at
		``Units/\*/VALGRIND-${language}.tmp``.

	``SHRINK=1``

		If exit status is non-zero, run ``units shrink`` to
		minimize the bad input. With bisection algorithm,
		*misc/units shrink* tries to make the shortest input
		which makes ctags exits with non-zero status.
		The result is reported to ``Units/\*/SHRINK-${language}.tmp``.
		Maybe useful to debug.

Automatic parser selection based on corpora
---------------------------------------------------------------------
For suffix *.m* ctags has two built-in parsers: ``ObjectiveC`` and
``Matlab``.  Which parser ctags should use? Here this situation is
called "parser confliction".

Like ``--language-force`` option ctags provides some ways to choose a
parser manually. However, it is nice if ctags choose a proper parser
without manual instruction.

With ``--<LANG>-corpus=spec:corpusFile`` option you can prepare corpus a
file to make ctags learn lexical tendency of a language. Ctags
learns it as typical input of ``LANG``. Based on the learning ctags
tries to solve the parser confliction. See *Data/optlib/mib.ctags*
and *Data/corpora/RFC1213-MIB.txt* as an example of the usage of
``--<LANG>-corpus``.

About ``ObjectiveC`` and ``Matlab`` parser, corpus files are embedded
in the parser implementations. See *objc.c* and *matlab.c*.

More documentation is needed.


Modeline based parser selection
---------------------------------------------------------------------
exuberant-ctags has the ability to choose a proper parser based on shebang
lines (e.g. *#!/bin/sh*). This feature is extended in fishman-ctags.

Editors like vim and emacs recognize special patterns in files, which are
called modelines. The line is inserted by a user of the text editor and can
be used to set the file type (Vim) or mode (emacs).

fishman-ctags also recognizes these modeline and selects a language parser
based on it if ``--guess-language-eagerly`` (or ``-G``) option is given.


ctags recognizes the following patterns used in emacs:

  * at the head of input file or at the line next of shebang line::

      -*- mode: MODE; -*-

    or ::

      -*- MODE -*-

  * at the end of input file::

      Local Variables:
      ...
      mode: MODE
      ...
      End:


ctags recognizes the following patterns used in vim:

  * at the end of input file::

      vim:set filetype=SYNTAX

    or ::

      ex:se ft=SYNTAX


NOTE: This feature takes some costs, opening the input file
before parsing, than selecting a parser by the input
file name. So this feature is enabled only if the option
is given. If you like this feature, you can put
``--guess-language-eagerly`` to your .ctags.

Better parser selection for template files
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Consider an input file name *foo.c.in*.  Suffix *.in* is popular as a
name for template files.  Well-known one is *config.h.in* used in GNU
autotools.

ctags used suffix here *\*.in* for choosing a parser. *.in* shows
nothing about the language used in the input file. When fishman-ctags
finds *.in* as suffix, fishman-ctags checks the next suffix, here *.c*.

Dry running
---------------------------------------------------------------------
With ``--print-language`` option, you can test the parser selector of
ctags. e.g.::

	$ ./ctags --print-language main.c
	main.c: C

If no parser is selected, ``NONE`` is printed as parser name.


Option library
---------------------------------------------------------------------

exuberant-ctags provides the way to customize ctags with options like
``--langdef=<LANG>`` and ``--regex-<LANG>``. An option file where options are
written can be loaded with ``--options=OPTION_FILE``.

fishman-ctags extends this feature. fishman-ctags treats option files
as libraries. Developers of fishman-ctags maintain some option files
as part of fishman-ctags. They are shipped as part of fishman-ctags
release. With ``make install`` they are also installed as ctags command
is.

fishman-ctags prepares directories where the option files are installed.

Consider you use a GNU/Linux distribution.
Following directories are searched when loading an option file.

#. *~/.ctags.d/optlib*
#. */etc/ctags/optlib*
#. */usr/share/ctags/optlib*

The name of an option file must have .conf or .ctags as suffix.

If ctags is invoked with following command line::

	$ ctags --options=mib ...

Following files are searched with following order for finding ``mib``:

#.  *~/.ctags.d/optlib/mib.conf*
#.  *~/.ctags.d/optlib/mib.ctags*
#.  */etc/ctags/optlib/mib.conf*
#.  */etc/ctags/optlib/mib.ctags*
#.  */usr/share/ctags/optlib/mib.conf*
#.  */usr/share/ctags/optlib/mib.ctags*

These are called built-in search path.

If you don't want ctags not to refer above search path, instead you
want to specify directly an option file with ``--options``, start the
parameter of the option with */* (absolute path) or *./* (relative path)
like::

	$ ctags --option=/home/user/test/mib.cf
	$ ctags --option=./test/mib.cf

Here the restriction about suffix doesn't exist.

On GNU/Linux you can add more directories with environment variable
named ``CTAGS_DATA_PATH``.

::

	$ CTAGS_DATA_PATH=A:B ctags --options=mib ...

Following files are searched with following order for finding *mib*:

#. *A/optlib/mib.conf*
#. *A/optlib/mib.ctags*
#. *B/optlib/mib.conf*
#. *B/optlib/mib.ctags*
#. *~/.ctags.d/optlib/mib.conf*
#.  ...

Further more you can use ``--data-path=[+]PATH`` for adding more directories
with environment variable::

	$ CTAGS_DATA_PATH=A:B ctags --data-path=+C --options=mib ...

In this case following files are searched with following order for
finding *mib*:

#. *C/optlib/mib.conf*
#. *C/optlib/mib.ctags*
#. *A/optlib/mib.conf*
#. *A/optlib/mib.ctags*
#. *B/optlib/mib.conf*
#. *B/optlib/mib.ctags*
#. *~/.ctags.d/optlib/mib.conf*
#. ...

If you omit *+*, instead of adding you can set a directory::

	$ CTAGS_DATA_PATH=A:B ctags --data-path=C --options=mib ...

In this case following files are searched with following order for
finding mib:

#. *C/config/mib.conf*
#. *C/config/mib.ctags*

With reserved file name ``NONE``, you can make the directory list empty::

	$ CTAGS_DATA_PATH=A:B ctags --data-path=NONE --options=mib ...

In this case ctags tries to load *./mib*.

See also "Loading option recursively".

How a directory is set/added to the search path can be watched with
``--verbose`` option. This is useful for debugging this feature.

fishman-ctags developers wait your pull request of well written
option files.

NOTE: Though ``--data-path`` is highest priority, ``--data-path`` doesn't
affect a stage of automatic option file loading. Following files are
automatically loaded when ctags starts:

#. */ctags.cnf* (on MSDOS, MSWindows only)
#. */etc/ctags.conf*
#. */usr/local/etc/ctags.conf*
#. *$HOME/.ctags*
#. *$HOME /ctags.cnf* (on MSDOS, MSWindows only)
#. *.ctags*
#. *ctags.cnf* (on MSDOS, MSWindows only)

NOTE: This feature is still in experimental. The name of directories,
suffix rules, and other convention will change.

TODO

* Write about MSWindows more(*.cnf*).
* ``accept_only_dot_ctags()`` doesn't  check *.cnf*.

See "Contributing an optlib" if you have a good optlib.

Loading option recursively
---------------------------------------------------------------------

The option file loading rules explained in "Option library" is more
complex.  If you specify a directory as parameter for ``--option`` instead
of a file, fishman-ctags loads option files under the directory
recursively.

Consider following command line on GNU/Linux distribution::

	$ ctags --options=bundle ...

Following directories are searched first:

#. *~/.ctags.d/optlib/bundle.d*
#. */etc/ctags/optlib/bundle.d*
#. */usr/share/ctags/optlib/bundle.d*

If *bundle.d* is found and it is a directory, files (*\*.ctags*
and *\*.conf*), directories (\*.d) are loaded recursively.

NOTE, TODO: If *bundle.d* is not found above list, a file
*bundle.ctags* or *bundle.conf* are searched. This rule is a bit
ugly. Following search rules looks better.

#. *~/.ctags.d/optlib/bundle.d*
#. *~/.ctags.d/optlib/bundle.ctags*
#. *~/.ctags.d/optlib/bundle.conf*
#. */etc/ctags/optlib/bundle.d*
#. */etc/ctags/optlib/bundle.ctags*
#. */etc/ctags/optlib/bundle.conf*
#. */usr/share/ctags/optlib/bundle.d*
#. */usr/share/ctags/optlib/bundle.ctags*
#. */usr/share/ctags/optlib/bundle.conf*

NOTE: This feature requires ``scandir`` library function. This feature may
be disabled on which platform scandir is not available. Check ``option-directory``
in the supported features::

	$ ./ctags --list-features
	wildcards
	regex
	option-directory


Directories for preloading
---------------------------------------------------------------------

As written in "Option library", option libraries can be loaded with
``--options`` option. However, you may want to load them without
specifying it explicitly.

Following files can be used for the purpose.

* ~/.ctags
* /ctags.cnf (on MSDOS, MSWindows only)
* /etc/ctags.conf
* /usr/local/etc/ctags.conf

This preloading feature comes from exuberant-ctags. However, I
think two weaknesses in this implementation.

* You have to edit the file when you want to add an
  option library to be loaded.

  If one wants to add or remove an ``--options=`` in a *ctags.conf*,
  currently one may have to use sed or something tool for adding or
  removing the line for the entry in */usr/local/etc/ctags.conf* (or
  */etc/ctags.conf*).

  I made a discussion about the similar issue in
  *http://marc.info/?t=129794755000003&r=1&w=2* about */etc/exports*
  of NFS.

* You cannot override the configuration defined in
  system administrator.

  A user must accept all configuration including ``--options=``
  in */etc/ctags.conf* and */usr/local/etc/ctags.conf*.

I prepare another facility. Let's not use older facility like *.ctags*.
I introduced following directories for preloading purpose.

#. *~/.ctags.d/preload*
#. */etc/ctags/preload*
#. */usr/share/ctags/preload*

All files and directories under the directories are loaded recursively,
but two restrictions:

* file/directory name

  The same suffix rules written in "Option library" and
  "Loading option recursively" are applied in preloading, too.

* overriding

  The traversing and loading are done in the order listed above.
  Once a file is loaded, another file with the same name is not loaded.
  Once a directory is traversed, another directory with the same name is
  not traversed.

  fishman-ctags prepares */usr/share/ctags/preload/default.ctags*.
  If you want ctags not to load it, make an empty file at
  *~/.ctags/default.ctags*. If you want to customize
  */usr/share/ctags/preload/default.ctags*, copy the file to
  *~/.ctags.d/default.ctags* and edit it as you want.

  Assume */usr/share/ctags/preload/something.d* exits.
  Some *.ctags* files are in the directory. With making
  an empty directory at *~/.ctags.d/something.d*, you
  can make ctags not to traverse */usr/share/ctags/preload/something.d*.
  As the result *.ctags* files under */usr/share/ctags/preload/something.d*
  are not loaded.

  If you want to customize one of file under
  */usr/share/ctags/preload/something.d*, you have to copy
  */usr/share/ctags/preload/something.d* to *~/.ctags.d/somethind.d* recursively.
  You can also use symbolic links. After copying or symbolic linking, edit
  one of the copied file.

This feature is heavily inspired by systemd.


Long regex flag
---------------------------------------------------------------------

I am thinking about making regex parser more useful by adding
more kind of flags to ``--regex-<LANG>`` expression. As explained in
*ctags.1* man page, ``b``, ``e`` and ``i`` are defined as flags in
exuberant-ctags.

Even if I add more flags like ``x``, ``y``, ``z``,..., I guess users
including I myself may not utilize them well. It is difficult for them
to memorize. In addition If many "option libraries" are contributed,
we have to maintain them.

For both users and developers the variety short flags are just
nightmares.

So fishman-ctags prepares API for defining long flags, which can be
used as aliases for short flags. The long flags requires more typing
but more readable.

Here is the mapping between short flag names and long flag names.

=========== ===========
short flag  long flag
=========== ===========
b           basic
e           extend
i           icase
=========== ===========

Long flags can be specified with surrounding ``{`` and ``}``.
So the following ``--regex-<LANG>`` expression ::

   --m4-regex=/^m4_define\(\[([^]$\(]+).+$/\1/d,definition/x

is the same as ::

   --m4-regex=/^m4_define\(\[([^]$\(]+).+$/\1/d,definition/{extend}

The characters ``{`` and ``}`` are not suitable in using command line.  My
intent is that using long flags in option libraries.


Exclusive flag in regex
---------------------------------------------------------------------

A line read from input files was matched with **all** regular expressions
defined with ``--regex-<LANG>`` (or ``--<LANG>-regex``). Each regular
expression matched successfully emits a tag.

In some cases another policy, exclusive-matching, is preferable to the
all-matching policy. Exclusive-matching means the rest of regular
expressions are not tried if one of regular expressions is matched
successfully,

For specifying exclusive-matching I introduced a flag ``exclusive``
(long) and ``x`` (short). It is used in *data/optlib/mib.ctags*::


	--mib-regex=/^([^ \t]+)[ \t]+DEFINITIONS ::= BEGIN/\1/d,definitions/{exclusive}
	--mib-regex=/^([a-zA-Z][^ \t]+)[ \t]+[A-Za-z]/\1/n,name/


passing parameter for long regex flag
---------------------------------------------------------------------

In internal APIs long-flag can take a parameter.
Conceptual example::

	--<LANG>-regex=/regexp1/replacement/kind-spec/{transformer=uppercase}
	--<LANG>-regex=/regexp2/replacement/kind-spec/{transformer=lowercase}
	--<LANG>-regex=/regexp2/replacement/kind-spec/{transformer=capitalize}

This is not used yet any user visible places.
This is implemented for extending ctags in future.

External parser command
---------------------------------------------------------------------

There are commands generating tags file specialized to a language.
`CoffeeTags <https://github.com/lukaszkorecki/CoffeeTags>`_ is an
example. CoffeeTags deals with scripts of coffee language. It is written in
Ruby. Therefore we cannot merge the parser into ctags
directly(Remember ctags written in C). However, the format of tags
file generated by CoffeeTags conforms `FORMAT
<http://ctags.sourceforge.net/FORMAT>`_ well. This means we can reuse
the output instead of reusing parser source code.

With new ``--<LANG>-xcmd=COMMAND`` option, ctags invokes ``COMMAND``
as an external parser command(xcmd) for input files written in
``LANG``. ctags merges the output of ``COMMAND`` into tags file.

By default following executable are searched with following order for finding
xcmd ``COMMAND``:

#. *~/.ctags.d/drivers/COMMAND*
#. */usr/libexec/ctags/drivers/COMMAND*

These are called built-in search path.

On GNU/Linux you can add more directories with environment variable
named ``CTAGS_LIBEXEC_PATH``. As same as ``CTAGS_DATA_PATH``, you can
set directories with ``:`` separators to ``CTAGS_LIBEXEC_PATH``.
When searching ``COMMAND``, ctags visits the directories before visiting
the built-in search path.

You can add more search paths with ``--libexec-dir=DIR`` option. ctags
visits ``DIR/drivers`` before visiting the directories specified with
``CTAGS_LIBEXEC_PATH`` and built-in search path. If ctags cannot find
``COMMAND``, ctags treats ``COMMAND`` as an executable file, and tries
to run it.

If you want to specify an executable file as ``COMMAND`` explicitly,
use absolute (starting with ``/``) or relative path (starting with
``.``) notations.

Generally you don't want to specify an executable file as ``COMMAND``
because ctags requires very specific behaviors(protocol) to
``COMMAND``. Generally available tags generator like CoffeeTags
doesn't conforms the protocol. Executable under the built-in search
path are expected to fill the gap between generally available tags
generator and fishman-ctags. This is the reason why the name
*drivers* is used as part of built-in search path.

If you want to write a driver for a tags generator, read
"xcmd protocol and writing a driver".

There are some restrictions of utilizing the xcmds.

doesn't work with ``-x``.

  ctags cannot generate cross reference file if
  ``--<LANG>-xcmd=COMMAND`` is specified.

doesn't work with ``-e``.

  ctags cannot generate TAGS, etags format output
  if ``--<LANG>-xcmd=COMMAND`` is specified.
