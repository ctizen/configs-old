fishman-ctags hacking guide
========================================================================



:Version: Draft
:Authors: fishman-ctags develoeprs
:Web Page: https://github.com/fishman/ctags

Introduction
======================================================================
fishman-ctags is a project/git repository/command forked from
exuberant-ctags. The project is hosted at github. fishman-ctags
repository is started by Reza Jelveh <reza.jelveh@gmail.com>.

The goal of the project is preparing and maintaining common/unified
space where people interested in making ctags better can work
together.

This guide is for developers. ctags.1 man page is for users.
Though ctags.1 is not updated yet because fishman-ctags is still in
development.

This document is far from perfect. I am still
researching the original code derived from exuberant-ctags.

Proofreading and pull-requests are welcome!
